### Solarium Wallet App  
The **Solarium Wallet App** is a simple and user-friendly Solana wallet interface built with React and the Solana Web3.js library. It empowers users to set up a sender account, connect their wallet via the Phantom browser extension, disconnect seamlessly, and execute SOL transfers efficiently.

   - Utilize the "Connect Wallet" option to link your Phantom wallet.  
   - Displays the wallet's public address upon connection.  

#### 3. **Wallet Disconnection**  
   - Use the "Disconnect Wallet" button to unlink your wallet instantly.

### **Key Considerations**

- The app runs on the Solana **Devnet** cluster by default. Update the `clusterApiUrl` setting in the source code to switch clusters if needed.
